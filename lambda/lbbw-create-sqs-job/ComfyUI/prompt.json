Put the white soccer jersey on the {gender} and keep the original background. Keep the facial features, hair and expression of the person consistent. The {gender} is standing in a massive shower of red and white rectangular confetti filling the air. Confetti is flying everywhere. Maintain all the small details of the soccer jersey including color and the logos and the embossed pattern on the white fabric of the jersey: The base color of the jersey is white, with a visually dynamic design featuring fine, textured, geometric embossments across the torso and lower front. These raised patterns add depth and tactile quality to the fabric, suggesting a high-performance polyester blend, commonly used in modern football kits for moisture-wicking and breathability. The material appears to be lightweight and stretchable, tailored for athletic performance.

The bottom left part of the jersey is clean white with the embossed pattern without other elements.

The most striking element is the red chest band, which runs horizontally across the front. This band is stylized with jagged, fragmented edges and arrow-like design elements, giving it a contemporary, disruptive look while maintaining the club’s traditional red band motif. This chest band contains the white sponsor logo "LBBW" (Landesbank Baden-Württemberg), rendered in bold, capital letters with a double-equals sign in the middle.

Club Crest: Located on the left chest, the VfB Stuttgart crest features a shield design. The top part has red stylized antlers and the letters “VfB” in a gothic script, while the lower yellow portion includes three black deer antlers—a symbol of Württemberg. Above the crest is a single gold star, denoting the club’s historic Bundesliga titles.

Manufacturer Logo: On the right chest is the JAKO logo in red.

Additional Sponsor Logos: 

Right Sleeve: Displays the black two-line  "·he sol" logo in lowercase Helvetica Bold font.

Shoulder Dot Detail:
Each shoulder features a row of five red circles, the first one closest to the collar is the circular JAKO logomark, followed by four more red dots arranged in a row, each becoming progressively smaller.

Collar and Cut
The jersey has a modern V-neck collar with a slight cross-over construction at the sharp corner in the center, adding to the premium and sporty appearance.

Keep face, hair and scenic photo background consistent.
Enhance the facial details.
